# media-meter

A Python tool to measure social media output.

What begin as an idea to stand-out has become a reason to merely stand.

Some lady who no longer works at the UMN yelled at me for starting to make this tool a few years ago.

So, I thought, *hey, why not keep workin' on it?!* ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

She no longer works there ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
